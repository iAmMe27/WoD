When starting a new game, create your character and once done, *DO NOTHING ELSE* and allow the mods to initialise. Once the notifications stop appearing in the top left of your screen, proceed to open the door to the bathroom and make your choice as to how you'd like to start the game. 
  
* When LIF gives you a pop-up at the start of the game, click `INJECT`

#### As of v0.5, Swag has added a custom MCM setup for a slightly different experience in WoD. Here's what Swag says it does:

> [!NOTE]
> this MCM setup is for profile 2 only!

```
Best run the the following MCM Config after the original "Wasteland of Depravity" one.

What does the MCM Preset "Swags Dommy Mommy Milkers Wasteland" do?
It pretty much does 3 main things.

  1. Changing NPC spawnrate primarily "Hostile ones" into mostly females, For example raiders and gunners etc.
  2. Adjusts "if possible" all MCM options to be only targeted/ approached by female NPCs
  3. Some personal "Quality of Life" adjustments, for example the chance of events that can happen etc.

Those are pretty much the big 3 changes it does.

Also if you don't like the sounds of this don't use it. Don't come at me berating me why anyone would want this or that's too much females etc. I really don't care and neither should you. Have a pleasant day.
```

The MCM setup is a one-click solution and will run when you tell it to. To do that;

1. Navigate to the Mod Config menu -> `-= MCM Settings Manager =-`
2. Click the `[Apply]` button.

3. Scroll down to find `Commonwealth Captives Outfit Injector`, head to `Global Settings`, click `Inject All Clothing` and wait for a message box to pop-up telling you that the outfit injection is done.

4. Exit the Mod Config menu

5. One that is done, make a new full save from the pause menu.
