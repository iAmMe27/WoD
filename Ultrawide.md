# I have an Ultrawide monitor, halp me!

My thanks for Swagmeister for figuring this out!

There are a couple of UI mods that allow for Ultrawide resolution support. I don't have an Ultrawide monitor myself, so I can't be 100% sure if this fixes every UI element. To enable Ultrawide support, open the `UI` separator in MO2, and activate `Ultra Wide Interface (21x9)` and `No Rainbox - 21-0 Rainbox Fix`.

When in game, you will likely need to head into the Mod Config menu > FallUI and tweak some of the widgets to fit your screen space properly.
