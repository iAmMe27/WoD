60. Updated LooksMenu to v1.6.20
    1.  This means you can toggle clothes on and off in LooksMenu now as well as actually use skin overrides. There was rumour that this version of LooksMenu broke some of the NSFW mods, especially for male characters/NPCs, but in all my testing, everything works 100% as intended.

The issue with the M249 Para is unfixable as the animations for it are made with a custom skeleton that is not compatible with the ZeX skeleton. See the Combined Arms mod page for more info.
