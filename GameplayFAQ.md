## Gameplay questions and problems

### Automatron is not starting!
WoD uses [Integrated Automatron](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/85317).
It imposes some delays and requirements before the quest may be started.

> [!TIP]
> There is a known bug in the currently integrated version of the mod that can make it really hard to start Automatron.  
> Resolving the issue includes waiting about a week more than is needed according to the mod page and may include travelling away and to [Wattz](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Wattz_Consumer_Electronics) a few times.  
>   
> This issue will be resolved in the next update of WoD with an updated version of Integrated Automatron.
