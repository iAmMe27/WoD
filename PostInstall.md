Navigate to the WoD installation folder and run MO2 by double-clicking `ModOrganizer.exe`.

> [!WARNING]
> DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES RUN LOOT. The load order is exactly as intended out of the box and you do not need to change it.

## Running WoD
Running WoD is as simple as clicking Run with the `Fallout: Wasteland of Depravity` option selected in the MO2 dropdown menu, in the top right of the window.

> [!WARNING]
> **Do not** click the `Unlock` button in MO2 whilst WoD is running. Doing this *will* cause issues and potentially crashes.

## Optional Mods
In Wasteland of Depravity, there are a few optional mods that you can toggle on/off for your playthrough.

### Essentials Category
1. Rusty Face Fix
   
> [!TIP]
> If you consistently run into the dreaded Fallout 4 rusty face issue, check things such as resolution of face textures and tint masks match if you added any skin or face texture mods.

### YOUR CHOICES Category
1. Discord Rich Presence (F4SE) - this gives you a card in Discord when you are playing WoD. It lists your character name, level and location. *It does not hook into the NSFW mods, don't worry, your secrets are safe.*
2. LOD Hiding Fog for NAC X - adds a small amount of fog to the clear and sunny weathers to help hide those nasty Fallout 4 LODs.
3. Be Afraid - Honest Difficulty Overhaul - YOU MUST START A NEW GAME FOR THIS TO TAKE EFFECT! This mod delevels the Commonwealth to make it dangerous.
4. Swags Optional Stuff - Changes Brothel visitors to females only.
5. Swags RDM Edit - Reduces the RDM headshot multipliers for some enemies to make them not 1 shot.
