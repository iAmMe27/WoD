## Optional Mods
In Wasteland of Depravity, there are a few optional mods that you can toggle on/off for your playthrough.

### Essentials Category
1. Rusty Face Fix
   
> [!TIP]
> Toggle this on if you consistently run into the dreaded Fallout 4 rusty face issue, provided you have checked things such as resolution of face textures and tint masks match.

### Character Presets Category
1. Maya - Custom Race Female Preset + AAF patch - you should only enable this if you plan on using the Maya character preset for your playthrough. **Do not enable this on an existing save!**

### YOUR CHOICES Category
1. Discord Rich Presence (F4SE) - this gives you a card in Discord when you are playing WoD. It lists your character name, level and location. *It does not hook into the NSFW mods, don't worry, your secrets are safe.*
2. LOD Hiding Fog for NAC X - adds a small amount of fog to the clear and sunny weathers to help hide those nasty Fallout 4 LODs.
3. Be Afraid - Honest Difficulty Overhaul - YOU MUST START A NEW GAME FOR THIS TO TAKE EFFECT! This mod delevels the Commonwealth to make it dangerous.
4. Swags Optional Stuff - Changes Brothel visitors to females only.
5. Swags RDM Edit - Reduces the RDM headshot multipliers for some enemies to make them not 1 shot.
