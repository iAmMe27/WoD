# Preface
Just to set some expectations and boundaries surrounding modlist development here, there's a couple things I'd like to say first.

1. As a modlist user, I expect some small efforts into fixing your own issues, mostly by searching the documentation provided here and by the Discord channels. It's very likely any issue you encounter has already been solved - if this is the case and it's well known, don't be surprised if you get ignored.
   
2. Support shouldn't be expected as instant - I have a full time job on top of this, as do my mod team, so I ask for a little bit of patience.
   
3. Do not expect a 100% polished, well-balanced and "perfect" experience. I am a 1-person dev team and expecting more from me than you would from AAA game studios is insanity.
   
4. We're modding a nearly 10 year old game here, please temper your expectations some.

## Accounts
In terms of accounts you will need:
  * Nexus Premium Account
  * LoversLab Account - *for manual downloads through your browser.*

## Fallout 4 Install
> [!WARNING]
> Your Steam install of Fallout 4 must be up to date - do not downgrade for WoD!

## DLC
You will need *all* of the DLC for Fallout 4 ***except*** the official HD texture pack.

# Updating Wasteland of Depravity
Updates are basically the same as an installation except you have to ensure that you have the "Overwrite" checkbox ticked in Wabbajack.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you've added mods, you better know how to stop Wabbajack from removing them.

# Need Support?

If you encounter any issues that are not answered in the installation routine, have a look at [Common Issues](CommonIssues.md) first.  
Gameplay information about some key mods in the list [here](Gameplay.md).  
There is also a [FAQ](FAQ.md) with common questions about MO2 and common ingame issues. 

If the documentation provided does not provide you with an answer, of if you just want to chat and hang out, feel free to join our discord (link below).

## Asking for support in Discord
If you want to ask for support in Discord, grab the "Wasteland" role in onboarding or in "Channels & Roles" at the top of the channel list.  
Before asking your question, please use the discord search function and check pinned messages in relevant channels.

Still haven't found an answer to your problem?  
Please make sure to ask your question in the appropriate channel.

- wod-general -> General discussion about the list or included mods.
- wod-modified -> Support-Channel for vanilla installs (if you changed files, added or deleted mods in your install, ask for support here).
- wod-support -> Support-Channel for vanilla (unchanged) installs.
