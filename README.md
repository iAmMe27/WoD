> [!TIP]
> Profile #1 contains the usual depravity, Profile #2 is for coomers who like NSFW artwork and creature *interactions*.

# Updating Wasteland of Depravity
Updates are basically the same as an installation except you have to ensure that you have the "Overwrite" checkbox ticked in Wabbajack.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you've added mods, you better know how to stop Wabbajack from removing them.
