**I need help with something!** Start with consulting the [Common Issues page](CommonIssues.md) and the [FAQ](FAQ.md). Please help me to help yourself here. Please also use the Discord search function in the WoD channels as your issue may already be solved. Do not just post a question in the support channel without doing your own research first.

# Preface
Just to set some expectations and boundaries surrounding modlist development here, there's a couple things I'd like to say first.

1. As a modlist user, I expect some small efforts into fixing your own issues, mostly by searching the documentation provided here and by the Discord channels. It's very likely any issue you encounter has already been solved - if this is the case and it's well known, don't be surprised if you get ignored.
   
2. Support shouldn't be expected as instant - I have a full time job on top of this, as do my mod team, so I ask for a little bit of patience.
   
3. Do not expect a 100% polished, well-balanced and "perfect" experience. I am a 1-person dev team and expecting more from me than you would from AAA game studios is insanity.
   
4. We're modding a nearly 10 year old game here, please temper your expectations some.

# Getting Started

## Hardware Requirements

|             | CPU                             | RAM                 | GPU                                             |
|-------------|---------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Minimum     | Intel 7th Gen,  AMD 3000 Series | 16GB DDR4 @ 3000MHz | RTX 2060, Radeon 5700 XT (at least 6GB of VRAM) |
| Recommended | Intel 9th Gen, AMD 5800X        | 32GB DDR4 @ 3600MHz | RTX 3070, Radeon 6800                           |

## Storage Space

|             | Total Space   | Storage Type        |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|

| Recommended | 400GB         | NVMe SSD            |

## Accounts
In terms of accounts you will need:
  * Nexus Premium Account
  * LoversLab Account - *for manual downloads through your browser.*

## Fallout 4 Install
> [!WARNING]
> Your Steam install of Fallout 4 must be up to date - do not downgrade for WoD!

## DLC
You will need *all* of the DLC for Fallout 4 ***except*** the official HD texture pack.

# What's the difference between the 3 profiles?
> [!TIP]
> Profile #1 contains the usual depravity, Profile #2 is for coomers who like NSFW artwork and creature *interactions*. Profile 3 is self explanatory (and before you ask, is built on Profile #1).

# Updating Wasteland of Depravity
Updates are basically the same as an installation except you have to ensure that you have the "Overwrite" checkbox ticked in Wabbajack.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you've added mods, you better know how to stop Wabbajack from removing them.
