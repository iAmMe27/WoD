# FAQ

## Can I play the vanilla intro?
No. It sucks and the game has been out since like, 2015. If you haven't played it by now, vanilla FO4 still exists :^)

## Can I add xyz?
I don't know, can you?

## Can YOU add xyz?
I don't take commissions. I don't take demands either.

## What do I do in WoD?
Whatever the hell you want, within reason. There's plenty of extra content in WoD, some of which you will find just by walking throughout the wasteland. Be sure to keep an eye on your quest log and radio too.

## Where the heck are all the crafting recipes?
I know the mod pages say that they are all in the Chem Station *but* we have ECO and Complex Sorter :^)

That means, all recipes will have been moved to their appropriate work station in the Universal Workbench. You can follow the quest to grab a portable one by the entrance to Vault 111 or you can make static ones from a settlement build menu.

## A NECK SEAM? REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
I know, I know. A lot of FO4 skin mods don't come with matching face textures, therefore leaving an obvious seam between the neck and body. Head into the High Poly Faces REDUX MCM and enable the `Seamless High Poly Head` for the player and then follow its instructions to fix it.

## How do I edit my body?
2 ways;

1. In LooksMenu > Body > Advanced - play with the sliders to your hearts content.
2. Press F3 to open the Screen Archer Menu > Looks > Body Morphs > Load and pick a body preset.

## Most importantly, can I play as a male PC?
You can if you want.

## How do I acquire *volunteers* for my settlements?
You need to craft a couple things at the Universal Workbench;

1. The Baton - find it in the `Weapon - Create` menu > Human Resources
2. A Kit - find it in the `Utility Station` menu > Human Resources

When an enemy gives up in combat, you can hit them with the baton to get started. Take them back to your settlement and then process them using the Human Resources Terminal.
