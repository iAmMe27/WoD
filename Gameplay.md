# So, what *am* I doing with these mods?

## The 2 large mods that offer a lot of the features in WoD
There are a fair few mods that change what you can do in certain situations. I recommend that you start with reading the mod pages of the 2 main underpinning mods:

* [Human Resources](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/156546-human-resources/)
* [Wasteland Dairy Framework (which is a vast mod)](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/142352-wasteland-dairy-framework)

Once you've read these mod pages, you should now have a general idea of things to do with the many enemies you run into in the wasteland.

## What about the Settlement Tidy Bot?
When you start a new save, you should get a quest to travel to Vault 111 - you don't need to go into the vault but follow the quest to unlock the bot and then you can build it from the workshop menu. You can find it under **Structures > Misc**.

## Can I keep settlers out of my house?
Sure can. Drop down Private Area Markers by placing the markers from the workshop menu. Find them under **Resources > Misc**.
