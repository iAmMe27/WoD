# So, what *am* I doing with these mods?

There are a fair few mods that change what you can do in certain situations. I recommend that you start with reading the mod pages:

* [Human Resources](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/156546-human-resources/)
* [AAF Violate](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/6657-aaf-violate/)
* [AAF SEU](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/7281-aaf-sex-em-up/)
* [Commonwealth Captives](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/14493-commonwealth-captives/)
* [Sex Attributes](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5436-aaf-sex-attributes-framework-4172023/)
* [Sexual Harassment](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5487-aaf-sexual-harassment-6242023/)
* [Hardship](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10387-aaf-hardship-beggar-whore/)
* [Dangerous Nights](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/12719-aaf-dangerous-nights/)

Once you've read these mod pages, you should now have a general idea of things to do and things you'll run into in the wasteland of depravity.

## What about the Settlement Tidy Bot?
When you start a new save, you should get a quest to travel to Vault 111 - you don't need to go into the vault but follow the quest to unlock the bot and then you can build it from the workshop menu. You can find it under **Structures > Misc**.

## Can I keep settlers out of my house?
Sure can. Drop down Private Area Markers by placing the markers from the workshop menu. Find them under **Resources > Misc**.

## What about stuff to do?
Most quest mods will be obvious - they affect the world in some way. You very likely won't miss them.

If I had to give you one hint though, it would be this: there's an decrepit office building nearby to the Cambridge Police Station that might be worth checking out.
