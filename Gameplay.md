# Wasteland of Depravity Gameplay

## Starting the Game
When starting the game, you'll create your character in the bathroom scene, same as always. Once you're done, head the bathroom door and you'll be given options on how you wish to start. 

Before you ask, no you cannot do the vanilla intro to the game, it's buggy at best and the game is nearly 10 years old at this point. If you want to do the main quest, head into Vault 111 and find the deceased Vault Dweller.

## Equipment Crafting
Crafting is changed from the base game. A lot of stuff has been moved to a specific multi-category workbench known as the Universal Workbench. You can make static versions from the usual workshop menu and there is a portable one near to the entrance of Vault 111.

There are also some unique crafting benches available as part of other mods but these should be self explanatory.

## SFW Gameplay Stuff
There are lots of small mods that make changes to the general gameplay flow in WoD. Most enhance the existing systems but some replace parts entirely.

### Enemies
Enemies are tweaked in various ways, including things such as changes to accuracy, allow for encounter zone relevelling to allow continuous scaling. Enemies now also have friendly fire enabled.

### Gameplay Systems
A few of the gameplay systems are tweaked in WoD to make things more interesting and hopefully to allow for some build diversity. VATS is replaced with VAFS, which is bullet-time type system instead of the terrible X-COM attempt that VATS usually is.

### Weapons
The weapons in WoD are replaced with modern guns. Energy weapons are not replaced and there are new Institute specific energy weapon types. There's far too many to list here, see the `Weapons` separator in MO2.

### Player Homes
There are a few new player homes to choose from, as well as some Workshop Framework blueprints for existing settlements.

### Settlements
Settlements have also had some attention to make building better and adding a bunch of stuff to build with. There is also a mod to allow settlements to defend themselves provided that they have the manpower and defences to do so, so you no longer need to rush back to random settlements to help out.

### Junk & Misc Items
Junk and misc items are now weightless. This is handled via a Synthesis patcher and can be redone just by running Synthesis.

## Quests
There are a bunch of new quests in WoD, lots of new NPCs to meet and even a couple different ways to finish the main story.

Want a Yes Man type ending for FO4? Well, now you can.

## NSFW Gameplay
There are a fair few mods that change what you can do in certain situations. I recommend that you start with reading the mod pages:

* [Human Resources](https://www.loverslab.com/topic/156546-human-resources/)
* [AAF Violate](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/6657-aaf-violate/)
* [AAF SEU](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/7281-aaf-sex-em-up/)
* [Commonwealth Captives](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/14493-commonwealth-captives/)
* [Sex Attributes](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5436-aaf-sex-attributes-framework-4172023/)
* [Sexual Harassment](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5487-aaf-sexual-harassment-6242023/)
* [Hardship](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10387-aaf-hardship-beggar-whore/)
* [Dangerous Nights](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/12719-aaf-dangerous-nights/)

Once you've read these mod pages, you should now have a general idea of things to do and things you'll run into in the wasteland of depravity.
